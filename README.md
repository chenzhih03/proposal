The daily published Congressional record contains massive information regarding the current proceedings and
debates of the United States congress. The Congressional records from 1973 to today are well documented and
labeled with proper topics. They are relatively easy to search. However, the older Congressional regards are not well kept. The goal of this project is to use natural language processing techniques and machine learning
approaches to assign proper topics to older Congressional regards, and perform analysis of those records across American history.
